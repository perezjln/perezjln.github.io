Julien Perez is leading the Machine Learning and Optimization group at the Naver Labs Europe. His research interests include deep learning and reinforcement learning. Beyond this research management activities, Julien is leading the Machine Reading and Dialog systems research activities.

Julien Perez hold a PhD obtained at Université Paris Sud under the supervision of Cécile Germain Renaud and Balazs Kégl in the Machine Learning group called TAO, Thème Apprentissage et Optimization at Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique (LRI). The main subject of Julien's research was non-Markovian decision processes and Deep Memory-Enhanced Recurrent Neural Networks. After defending his PhD in 2010, Julien spent a year of post-doctoral at Telecom Paris Tech and two years as an assistant professor at Université Paris Est Créteil. He joined Naver Labs Europe (former known as Xerox Research Centre Europe) in sept. 2013.
