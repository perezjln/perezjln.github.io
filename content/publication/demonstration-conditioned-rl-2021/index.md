abstract: "This paper introduces a novel approach for few-shot imitation learning through demonstration conditioned reinforcement learning. We develop algorithms that enable agents to quickly adapt to new tasks using only a few demonstrations while maintaining robust performance. Our method combines the strengths of imitation learning and reinforcement learning to achieve efficient skill transfer in complex environments."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
