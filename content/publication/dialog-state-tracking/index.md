abstract: "Dialog state tracking is a key component of task-oriented dialog systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to dialog state tracking by framing it as a machine reading comprehension problem. We develop a Memory Network-based architecture that can effectively track dialog states by reading and comprehending the dialog history. Our approach treats the dialog context as a passage and the slot-value pairs as questions to be answered based on the context. The proposed model demonstrates strong performance on standard dialog state tracking benchmarks and provides interpretable attention mechanisms that highlight relevant parts of the dialog history for each tracked slot."
