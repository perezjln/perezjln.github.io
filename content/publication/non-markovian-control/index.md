abstract: "In this paper, we present a novel neural network architecture for sequential decision making in non-Markovian environments. The proposed architecture, called Gated End-to-End Memory Policy Network (GMemPN), augments the standard policy gradient approach with an external memory module that maintains a representation of the agent's interaction history. The memory module is implemented using a differentiable neural memory architecture that allows the agent to selectively read and write information based on the current observation and previous experiences. We evaluate our approach on several non-Markovian control tasks and demonstrate significant improvements over standard policy gradient methods and other memory-augmented approaches."
