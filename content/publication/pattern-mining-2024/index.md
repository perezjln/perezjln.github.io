abstract: "This paper presents a novel scalable approach to differentiable pattern mining that incorporates coverage regularization. The method enables end-to-end learning of pattern mining tasks while maintaining computational efficiency on large-scale datasets. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements over traditional pattern mining techniques by leveraging modern deep learning optimization strategies."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
