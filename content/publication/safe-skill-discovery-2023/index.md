abstract: "This paper introduces a novel approach for safe skill discovery in robotic manipulation tasks. We develop algorithms that enable robots to autonomously discover new manipulation skills while ensuring safety constraints are maintained throughout the learning process. Our method combines reinforcement learning with safety-aware exploration strategies to achieve robust skill acquisition in real-world robotic scenarios."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
