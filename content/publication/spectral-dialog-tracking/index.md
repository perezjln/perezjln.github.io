abstract: "Dialog state tracking is a fundamental component of spoken dialog systems. In this paper, we propose a novel spectral decomposition method for dialog state tracking based on collective matrix factorization. Our approach leverages the inherent structure in dialog data by modeling the relationships between dialog acts, slots, and values through low-rank matrix decompositions. The collective factorization framework allows us to capture dependencies across multiple related tasks simultaneously, leading to improved tracking performance. We evaluate our method on standard dialog state tracking challenges and demonstrate competitive results with reduced computational complexity compared to existing approaches."
