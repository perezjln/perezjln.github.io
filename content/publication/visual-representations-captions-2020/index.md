abstract: "This paper explores novel approaches for learning visual representations using caption annotations. We develop methods that leverage the rich semantic information present in natural language descriptions to improve visual understanding. Our approach demonstrates that caption-based supervision can lead to more robust and transferable visual representations compared to traditional supervised learning methods."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
