abstract = "During the last couple of years, a significant developement has been observed in the research community of deep learning. Beyond the classical paradigm of supervised learning, novel neural models and learning methods have been proposed to exploit the notions of memory and attention. Using these innovations, a novel set of tasks are now investigated like machine reading, dialog systems and algorithm learning. In this talk we will introduce this evolution of the field of deep learning, give a technical presentation of gated end to end memory-enhanced neural networks and illustrate their usage for machine reading and dialog systems learning. Finally, this talk will be an opportunity to discuss the paradigm shift that the research and engineering communities of deep learning and AI are confronting today, evolving from neural networks design to differentiable programming."
